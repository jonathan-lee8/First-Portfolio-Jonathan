# My-First-Portfolio

Thanks for checking my portfolio. This portfolio highlights some of the work I have done with HTML and CSS. The code contains semantic elements and order. The headings are responsive and the UI will take you where you want. There is room for improvement but the current portfolio highlights not only myself, but the work samples I have created.
